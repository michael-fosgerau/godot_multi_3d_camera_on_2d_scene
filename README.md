# Godot multi 3D camera on 2D scene example

This example shows how to render multiple 3D cameras in a 3D scene to multiple sprites in a 2D scene. This can be used to make e.g. split-screen rendering for 3D multiplayer games, having one shared 3D scene with two cameras being updated according to player interactions. 

The code can easily be modified to have content from more than one 3D scene, and/or to render to one or more 2D scenes - but that's beyond the point here.

The full godot example project can be found here: https://github.com/michael-fosgerau/godot_multi_3d_camera_on_2d_scene. The example I've made here is based on https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects

Not sure what godot can do? This seems to simple for you? Well... With practice you can achieve something like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sPFBmnfEEM - and I think that is pretty darn cool :-D
